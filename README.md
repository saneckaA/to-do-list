# To Do List

## Description
In this project I've made an app which allows you to make your own to do list. After adding a new task you can mark it as done by clicking the left button with "X" sign. 
The sign will change to "âœ“" sign and the whole task will be crossed out. You can also remove a task from your list by clicking the bin button. 
For more information you can write to me by clicking the link at the bottom of the site.
